# spid-php-lib-example

This repository contains a basic demo application based on [spid-php-lib](https://github.com/italia/spid-php-lib), easy to setup thanks to [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/).

The supplied [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file defines and runs a two-container Docker application that comprises:
- this SPID Service Provider (SP) example
- and the SPID test Identity Provider (IdP) [spid-testenv2](https://github.com/italia/spid-testenv2) configured to talk to each other.

## Getting Started

Tested on: amd64 Debian 10 (buster, next stable) with Docker 18.06 and Docker Compose 1.17.

1. Install prerequisites:
```sh
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

2. Run `docker-compose up --build`

3. Visit the SP homepage http://localhost:8099/ and click `login` (user: `test`, password: `test`)

4. Visit the IdP homepage http://localhost:8088/ to review its configuration.

This screencast shows what you should see if all goes well:

To stop the two containers and remove them and all the other bits created by `docker-compose up`, run the command:
```sh
docker-compose down
```

If you relaunch the docker-compose after a while, make sure you run it with the latest version of the SPID test IdP:
```sh
docker pull italia/spid-testenv2
```
